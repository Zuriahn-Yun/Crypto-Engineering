# Crypto-Engineering
heiken ashi and candles, 15 minutes????

ethereum, 
bitcoin
solana


NEW PLAN 
Crypto dashboard on github pages that fetches live prices from local api using tailscale

[GitHub Pages Frontend (React or HTML/JS)]
         |
         | (fetch)
         v
[Your Local API (Flask or FastAPI) exposed via Tailscale]

NEW PLAN????
I THINK ai agent projects should take priority over things like this, i want to work on the gh project and something else maybe
I think if this just displays the plotly plot in gh pages, maybe that is good enough for now, 


FRONTEND(GHPAGES) - BACKEND API CALL -> DISPLAY GRAPH IS ALL ANY COIN VERY NICE
