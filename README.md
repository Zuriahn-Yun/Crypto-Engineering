Data Pipeline
COINGECKO_API -> Data ->

What can we do currently,
extract data for any coin, from x many days ago, transfer that data


What do I want to do, all the hourly times get extracted around exactly 4:01 every day, that is not useful,what if we plot all the crypto data, with several x plots or whatever and use a cv to anaylze
